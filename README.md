##### TIVTW
## The‌‌‌‌ Internet‌‌‌‌ VS‌‌‌‌ The‌‌ Web

Alright, before we start talking about TOR and the Dark Web. we need to first talk about the basics of the internet and the web. It is a common misinterpretation that the internet and the web are the same thing. 

![image of web vs internet](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CX_HyY3kbZw/maxresdefault.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### WITI
### What‌‌ is‌‌ the‌‌ Internet?

The ___internet___ is a massive network of networks, millions of computers, devices, and servers all connected globally. 

On the internet, devices use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices together worldwide (sort of like a address for your house. In order to know where to send packets/data to, there has to be an "address" to send it to. For more information about IP Addresses, go [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address).)

> "The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the federal government of the United States in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication with computer networks.[1] The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)

Most basic old communication media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers were soon remade or completley forgot about by the birth and graduation of the Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### WITW
### What‌‌ is‌‌ the‌‌ Web?

The **Web** (or better known as the "World Wide Web") is *the software that runs on the internet*. Its a way of sharing information across different types of computers. 

Browsers with search engines nowadays just have their own protocol/rule setup in order to figure out how to find different pages on the web.

There are two main parts of the web that really make it up. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### URLs
#### URLs

The **URLs** (Unique Resource Locators) *is normally reffered to as a web address*. URLs allow us to easily find out different webpages by using **DNS** (Domain Name System). This system *allows websites to have a domain (such as www.google.com) to be assigned to a computer*. 

The reason this is very useful is because, one, Its easier to remember google.com then an IP address like 1.83.132.2, and two, IP addresses change overtime for different reasons. It is easier to type "google.com" on your browser than to find the newest IP of google's webpage. 

![url image](https://hostimul.com/uploads/catalog/new_hostingg/url_diagram.png)

URls normally contain the **protocol**, **hostname**, and **filename**. <br>
For instance, the URL: "http://www.example.com/index.html" has... <br>
The protocol of http, <br>
The hostname of www.example.com, <br>
and <br>
The filename of index.html.

URLs commonly mean wwebpages that use **HTTP** or **HTTPS** (HyperText Transport Protocol or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), but are also used for other file transfering, emails, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### SNH
#### Server‌‌ (Normally‌‌ HTTP)

A **server** (in computing) is commonly reffered to as *a system that responds to requests across a computer network worldwide to provide, or help to provide, a network or data service*.

> Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing))

Servers normally contain web pages or data that you can easily access with the use of URLs. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### POTW
## Parts‌‌ of‌‌ the‌‌ Web

When we mean parts of the web, we are going to be talking about the three parts of it. The **clear**, **deep**, and **dark** web, all of which are very different from one another.

![web iceberg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Deepweb_graphical_representation.svg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### TCW
### The‌‌ Clear‌‌ Web

The clear web is any website that can be accessed by a search engine.

Things on the clearweb would be: 
- The youtube homepage 
(When not logged in and using incognito mode)
- The gmail sign-in page
- Wikipedia

##### HDIATCW
#### How‌‌ do‌‌ I‌‌ access‌‌ the‌‌ Clear‌‌ Web?

Heres a simple way. Go on google (or duckduckgo), type whatever you want in their search engine, and BAM you are now looking at stuff on the clearweb that was given by that specific search engine for that specific topic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### TDW
### The‌‌ Deep‌‌ Web

Most people, funny enough, mistake the Deep Web for the Dark Web. 

The Deep web is the part of the World Wide Web which is not discoverable by the normal use of search engines. 

This includes password protected webpages, dynamic web pages (changing/automatically moving data webpages) or encrypted networks. 

Examples of Deep Web Pages would be:
- Your signed-into gmail account
- Your recommended youtube page
(Whether signed in or not, it still uses data to give something pertaining to you only)
- A private instagram or facebook account

##### HDIATDW
#### How‌‌ do‌‌ I‌‌ access‌‌ the‌‌ Deep‌‌ Web?

Its very simple. Go on any webpage that requires you to sign in or has specific stuff only pertaining to your computer. 

For instance, the youtube hompage has stuff recommended to you based on your past watch history, searches, etc. I can't google '[person's name's] youtube homepage'. 

Same thing with accounts. If you have a gmail account, I can't just google '[person's name's] gmail account', as it requires a password to gain access to it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### TDKW
### The‌‌ Dark‌‌ Web

This is probably the most misinterpreted part of the Web.
Most people confuse this term with the Deep Web, and many explorings of the “Deep Web” has been overly exaggerated. 

The Dark web is the parts of the World Wide Web which is only accessible by the use of special software. 

These special software can access specific sites relating to their setup, these are normally called “Darknets”. The entire amount of darknets together is what we call the “Dark Web”. Normally these types of sites require a specific software (normally a browser). 

It is **NOT ILLEGAL** to go on the darkweb! It **IS** illegal to go on the Darkweb and doing illegal actions such as buying illegal drugs!

##### HDIATDKW
#### How do I access the Dark Web?

The Darkweb normally is accessed by these special browsers with anonominity in-mind. This means these types of browsers allow for anonminity to it's users.

The type of Darkweb browser we will talk about today is the TOR Browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### TTWB
## The‌‌ TOR‌‌ Web‌‌ Browser

![Tor Browser image](https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tor-browser-8.0-new-onboarding.png)

Before we talk about how to use the Tor Browser, we will talk about it's history and how it works.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### TH
### TOR's‌‌ History

> The Tor Project was founded by computer scientists Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson and five others in December 2006. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) acted as The Tor Project's fiscal sponsor in its early years, and early financial supporters of The Tor Project included the U.S. International Broadcasting Bureau, Internews, Human Rights Watch, the University of Cambridge, Google, and Netherlands-based Stichting.net. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tor_Project)

The government had soon, around this time, wanted to make an anonymous type of network to help CIA and FBI agents with their research. However, they soon realized a problem.

> "The United States government simply can't run an anonminity system for everybody and then use it themselves only. Because then everytime a connection came from it, it would say 'oh its another CIA agent looking at my website'." 
<br>- Roger Dingledine (Co-Founder & Director of the TOR Project)

The government NEEDS to make TOR free for everyone because its the only way to make everyone anonymous. It's an either everyone or no one situation.

Nowadays (the time of me writing this), around 80% of all funds for the TOR project has been provided by the U.S Government with the TOR browser (which uses the system) being free for anyone to use and download.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### HTW
### How‌‌ TOR‌‌ Works

The TOR browser is not just "magically" anonymous. In order to make it so no one views the traffic of it's users or be able to tell where a connection is coming from, TOR uses a system called the "Onion Routing Protocol". 

Essentially, The Onion Routing (TOR) Protocol is a ruleset that computers use to connect to services through TOR. 

Heres how it works:
1. Your computer connects to TOR services (such as through the browser)
2. Your computer's sends a connection/request
3. This request is sent to a server around the world
4. The request is then sent by this server to a second server
5. The request is then sent from the second server to a third server
6. The third server obtains the request and sends back the information, the same way it came, to the user.

![image of onion routing protocol](https://devopedia.org/images/article/160/7739.1553230156.png)

This system allows it to be extremley difficult for anyone else to tell where the connection really came from, as the connection is sent beteen three different servers (similar to layers of an onion).

For more information on The Onion Routing Protocol, please read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### DT
### Downloading‌‌ TOR

**Make sure to read the Saftey on the Darkweb and TOR before downloading it!**

The TOR Browser can be downloaded from the official website:
[https://www.torproject.org/](https://www.torproject.org/)

DO **NOT** download the browser from any other site but this one! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### SOTDAT
## Saftey‌‌ on‌‌ the‌‌ Darkweb‌‌ and‌‌ Tor

![saftey](https://ssd.eff.org/files/2019/04/02/tor_download.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### OS
### Operating‌‌ Systems

An operating system is the software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals.

There are five (at least well known) kinds of Operating Systems, **Windows**, **Mac OS**, **iOS/iPhone)**, **Android**, and **Linux**

##### Windows
#### Windows
Simple answer, don't use this if you plan on accessing the Darkweb with TOR. Windows (because of it's wide use, not because of its system) is the most unsecure operating system to use.

##### MOS
#### Mac‌‌ OS
Though it is generally the more secure than Windows machines, that doesn't mean it doesn't have any security flaws. Don't use this system if you're accesing the Darkweb either.

##### iOS
#### iOS/iPhones
Honestly, this is one of the most secure operating systems you could possibly use. However, due to its lack of support for TOR and customization for security, I would not recommend it for Darkweb use.

##### Android
#### Android
This is very similar to Windows, I would not recommend using this at all for Darkweb use.

##### Linux
#### Linux
This one is the operating system with the most amount of support for TOR. Due to Linux being very secure (because of its limited use) and being extremley customizable, there are many distrobutions (versions) of linux that were made for Darkweb/Tor browsing. 

Heres a list of Linux distrobutions **made for TOR** and **extreme security** use: <br>
(From most to least secure out of this list)
* [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) (By Installation)
* [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/) (By Virtual Machine)
* [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) (By Harddrive)

Heres a list of other Linux distrobutions that focus on security and not so much in TOR use: <br>
(From most to least secure out of this list)
* [Discreete Linux](https://www.privacy-cd.org/)
* [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/)
* [BlackArch Linux](https://blackarch.org/)
* [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/)
* [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) (Use only if you know what you're doing)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### CS
### Common‌‌ Sense
Yep, a major way of being safe on the Darkweb or TOR in general is having common sense. 

Heres some tips that can help you for general TOR use:
- Don't click on suspicious links
- Don't publisize critical information
- You technically won't be anonymous if you use public services, such as gmail, on TOR.

Heres some tips that can help you when accessing the Darkweb through TOR:
- Don't post anything (THIS INCLUDES IMAGES).
- Don't log into any public sites before going on the Darkweb.
- Don't make accounts with personal information (this includes passwords)
- Just don't make login for anything.
- Don't leak your information, people still do this so I'm saying it here.
- Make sure you don't use your real daily computer (even if you're using a VPN or Virtual Machine).
- Don't access the Darkweb in public areas/WiFis.
- The way you type on a computer could be traced back to you, just don't type anything/post anything at all.
- #1 TIP, DON'T BE STUPID.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### TSF
### TOR‌‌ Security‌‌ Features

On TOR, there are many pre-set security featues you can use to stay safe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### WOTD
### Websites‌‌ on‌‌ the‌‌ Darkweb‌‌ (.onion‌‌ sites)

Though TOR can be used for normal anonymous searching, TOR also had websites that can be seen by the browser itself only.

TOR has a "hidden service" with websites that have completley randomized domains with .onion instead of stuff such as .org or .com. These websites are ones that can ONLY be accessed by the TOR browser.

There is a misconseption that there are ONLY bad websites on the Dark Web. Yes, there ARE bad sites on there, however there are also sites where people can express themselves due to anonominity.

Most of the websites can't be accessed normally by a simple domain as their domains change randomly every once-in-a-while. Instead, to access websites like these, you need to find websites that list all of these .onion sites. A good one that is very mainstream for TOR is called [The Hidden Wiki](https://thehiddenwiki.org/) 

![http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=21n17he&s=9](https://steemitimages.com/p/sML2JBPsdAyPJdJu9ShDdyVTMnfcXMFHEk4Mck6SdqehKTt89PeNnDtRkwVDTmgJ?format=match&mode=fit&width=640)

These websites also may have a product you can buy. These products are not payed with the normal online creditcard, but are payed with a cryptocurrency known as [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### GW
#### Good‌‌ Websites
***Heres where I will list all the "good"/partially legal/society accepted websites that have been made because of TOR's services.***

##### HW
#### Hosting‌‌ Websites
These are websites that, for a cost, alloww you to host your very own .onion website.

##### MW
#### Medication/Drug‌‌ Websites
Yes, illegal drugs are bad. However, sites like these allow for people who, maybe because of their situation or country they live it, be able to buy medication for illnesses without going broke or going against their country's law.

##### GEW
#### Government‌‌ Expose‌‌ Websites 
The government hides many things that could be critical information for the public to know about. These are sites that expose governments' "sketchy" actions without being silenced for getting the information illegaly.

##### UNS
#### Unfilitered‌‌ News‌‌ Sites
These are sites similar to those on Government Expose Websites. These kinds of sites give information that was hidden from public eyes or are news based on things going on in the TOR network. These sites help you keep up to date with real world events going on without it being hidden or filtered.

##### OTHER
#### Other
These kinds of sites are where people can simply post information or their thoughts without being judged by society. Yes, *some* of these sites might be... "weird", but they allow for people to share their ideas and thoughts. This includes forums, blogs, Politcal stuff, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### BW
#### Bad‌‌ Websites
***Here is where I will list all the "bad" websites on TOR, their misconseptions, and please don't go on these types of sites. The only way you can go on these websites is if you choose to.***

##### RR
#### Red‌‌ Rooms
Ok lets get this one out of the way. **RED ROOMS DO NOT EXIST**. This is an urban legend that would be shut-down immedietly if it really did exist, or would be so hidden from the public that they basically don't exist. Any websites that claim they host redrooms on the darkweb are lying and mainly are there to scam users out of their money.

##### HW
#### Hitman‌‌ Websites
These websites are on a "greyish area" of wether they really exist or not. Hitman websites like these are normally false and have been known to give customer's information to local police. However, there is no proof that some websites ARE real or not. No one (who is good) wants to pay $20,000+ worth of bitcoin to hire a hitman on someone. For one, that person might go to jail because they hired someone. Another thing, they might be scammed of that large amount of money. These websites normally scam users out of their money and you should not be hiring hitmen anyways.

##### PW
#### Hacker/Pirating‌‌ Websites
These sorts of websites are in a grey area as well, but for different reasons. Someone websites explain saftey on TOR or release information of code that have been hidden from the public, which may contain major exploits that need to be patched. You could debate whether sharing malicious code could be bad or good, as the code itself, when shared publically through TOR services, means there can be a patch found for it as well. On the other hand there are also hacker sites such as ones that allow users to hire hackers, buy/download pirated products, etc. 

##### CPW
#### Child/Animal‌‌ Pornography/Abuse Websites
Yes, there are child pornography and animal pornography websites on TOR's services. There is not much to be said about these websites other than there are gigabites and terabytes of images or videos of torture, sex/rape, sex/rape torture, and abuse of children/animal. Stay as far away from these websites as you can, these are the extremley disturbing .onion sites.

##### DW
#### Medication/Drug‌‌ Websites
Yes, there are websites where you can buy drugs/illegal medications. These sites are very "customer friendly" and ship drugs to users who want to buy them for quite cheap. 

##### FW
#### Gun/Firearm‌‌ Websites
Yes, there are websites where you can buy illegal/legal firearms and have them shipped to you. However, not just the fact that they are illegal, but these sites can scam customers out of their money. Remember this is all anonymized, you can't call the police for someone you don't know and have no confirmation of paying, for stealing money from you after you tried buying a product illegally.
